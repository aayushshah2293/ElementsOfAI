It PRON stretched VERB to ADP an DET impossible ADJ height NOUN , . climbing VERB the DET wall NOUN to ADP the DET ceiling NOUN . .

There PRT were VERB no DET witch NOUN burnings NOUN here ADV because ADP everyone NOUN had VERB a DET witch NOUN in ADP the DET family NOUN . .

Oh PRT , . yes ADV , . I'm PRT quite ADV sure ADJ it's PRT important ADJ , . because ADP of ADP the DET Beech NOUN Pasture NOUN . .   
What's PRT that DET ? . ? .

You PRON see VERB , . besides ADV being VERB custodian NOUN of ADP antiquities NOUN , . I PRON am VERB also ADV registrar NOUN . .   
No ADV , . I PRON don't VERB hold VERB with ADP those DET who PRON live VERB entirely ADV among ADP dead ADJ things NOUN . .

But CONJ you've PRT got VERB to PRT know VERB both DET . .

As ADP I PRON was VERB saying VERB , . I've PRT known VERB all PRT about ADP the DET old ADJ records NOUN , . including ADP the DET old ADJ Norberg NOUN deed NOUN . .   
Some DET ten NUM years NOUN ago ADV that DET page NOUN was VERB torn VERB out PRT , . I PRON don't VERB know VERB by ADP whom PRON . .

He's PRT always ADV like ADP that DET , . in ADP spite ADP of ADP being VERB a DET big ADJ man NOUN . .   
( . When ADV you PRON see VERB him PRON , . you'll PRT notice VERB his DET habit NOUN of ADP fingering VERB , . I PRON might VERB almost ADV say VERB , . stroking VERB a DET large ADJ mole NOUN with ADP black ADJ hairs NOUN on ADP it PRON , . by ADP his DET right ADJ temple NOUN . .

Like ADP his DET glossy ADJ black ADJ hair NOUN . .   
Too ADV many ADJ outside ADJ manners NOUN , . to ADP my DET taste NOUN . .   
He PRON is VERB the DET sort NOUN who PRON , . with ADP an DET appraising VERB eye NOUN , . would VERB cross VERB the DET street NOUN to PRT help VERB a DET strange ADJ woman NOUN on ADP to ADP a DET bus NOUN and CONJ then ADV pinch VERB her PRON . .   
A DET real ADJ gentleman NOUN , . I PRON feel VERB , . would VERB do VERB neither DET . .   
He's PRT always ADV worn VERB a DET broad-brimmed ADJ hat NOUN , . and CONJ I've PRT noticed VERB , . in ADP my DET small ADJ study NOUN at ADP the DET Society NOUN , . that ADP he PRON rather ADV smells VERB of ADP cosmetics NOUN . .   
The DET next ADJ week NOUN , . cousin NOUN Red NOUN wandered VERB in PRT as ADV casually ADV , . but CONJ curt ADJ and CONJ untidy ADJ . .   
Red NOUN was VERB small ADJ and CONJ fine-boned ADJ , . like ADP ivory-inlay NOUN . .   
He PRON too ADV asked VERB to PRT see VERB the DET same ADJ page NOUN . .   
When ADV I PRON told VERB him PRON someone NOUN had VERB torn VERB it PRON out PRT , . he PRON shouted VERB . .   
`` . By ADP God NOUN , . it's PRT that DET damn ADJ Handley NOUN , . the DET sneak NOUN '' . ! . ! .   
And CONJ later ADV in ADP the DET same ADJ week NOUN they PRON both DET came VERB together ADV to PRT examine VERB the DET register NOUN . .   
Fortunately ADV we PRON were VERB alone ADV in ADP the DET building NOUN -- . so ADV few ADJ people NOUN nowadays ADV are VERB interested VERB even ADV in ADP their DET own ADJ past NOUN or CONJ in ADP the DET lovely ADJ craft NOUN of ADP other ADJ days NOUN -- . for ADP they PRON began VERB to PRT abuse VERB each DET other ADJ in ADP the DET foulest ADJ language NOUN . .   
Red ADJ thrusting VERB out PRT his DET tawny ADJ beard NOUN , . Handley NOUN glowering VERB under ADP his DET suddenly ADV rumpled VERB black ADJ hair NOUN . .   
They PRON actually ADV bristled VERB . .   
Le X rouge X et X le X noir X . .   
Violent ADJ men NOUN both DET . .   
Red ADJ always ADV was VERB morose ADJ , . yet ADV that DET day NOUN the DET dapper ADJ Handley NOUN was VERB the DET louder ADJ of ADP the DET two NUM . .   
But ADP for ADP my DET presence NOUN , . they PRON would VERB have VERB been VERB at ADP each DET others' NOUN throats NOUN . .   
During ADP the DET quarrel NOUN I PRON learned VERB what DET the DET trouble NOUN was VERB , . from ADP the DET accusations NOUN each DET hurled VERB at ADP the DET other ADJ . .   
The DET Beech NOUN Pasture NOUN had VERB suddenly ADV become VERB valuable ADJ . .   
There's PRT a DET fine ADJ granite NOUN quarry NOUN there ADV , . and CONJ granite's PRT coming VERB back ADV for ADP public ADJ buildings NOUN . .   
Both DET men NOUN knew VERB it PRON was VERB in ADP the DET Norberg NOUN family NOUN holdings NOUN , . but CONJ to ADP which DET of ADP the DET cousins NOUN did VERB it PRON belong VERB , . Anta NOUN or CONJ Freya NOUN ? . ? .   
Fortunately ADV , . I PRON knew VERB almost ADV exactly ADV what DET the DET will NOUN had VERB said VERB . .   
It PRON began VERB with ADP a DET preamble NOUN , . of ADP course NOUN . .   
This DET explained VERB that ADP the DET judge NOUN of ADP probate NOUN of ADP Essex NOUN County NOUN , . 1785 NUM or CONJ 1786 NUM , . appointed VERB three NUM free-holders NOUN of ADP Gloucester NOUN to PRT divide VERB and CONJ establish VERB the DET Norberg NOUN estate NOUN . .   
After ADP the DET usual ADJ Honorable ADJ Sirs NOUN , . it PRON went VERB on PRT to PRT say VERB that ADP there PRT had VERB been VERB set VERB off PRT to ADP the DET widow NOUN one NUM full ADJ third ADJ part NOUN of ADP the DET real ADJ estate NOUN of ADP the DET deceased ADJ Salu NOUN Norberg NOUN , . one NUM lower ADJ room NOUN , . on ADP the DET Western ADJ side NOUN , . privileges NOUN to ADP the DET well NOUN and CONJ bake-oven NOUN and CONJ to ADP one NUM third ADJ of ADP the DET cellar NOUN ( .

And CONJ I PRON remember VERB that ADP the DET whole NOUN of ADP the DET privileges NOUN , . not ADV counting VERB the DET Beech NOUN Pasture NOUN , . was VERB valued VERB at ADP twenty NUM pounds NOUN . .   
I PRON wish VERB you PRON could VERB have VERB seen VERB the DET crests NOUN fall VERB on ADP these DET two NUM sparring VERB coxcombs NOUN when ADV I PRON told VERB them PRON that ADP obviously ADV the DET pasture NOUN belonged VERB to ADP their DET wives NOUN jointly ADV . .   
That DET battle NOUN scene NOUN , . ridiculous ADJ as ADP it PRON was VERB , . remained VERB in ADP my DET mind NOUN . .   
A DET disturbing ADJ picture NOUN of ADP bad ADJ blood NOUN , . to PRT be VERB further ADJ heightened VERB with ADP illicit ADJ if ADP buccolic ADJ colors NOUN , . for ADP on ADP a DET subsequent ADJ day NOUN I PRON saw VERB Handley NOUN escorting VERB Anta NOUN , .

I PRON felt VERB it PRON would VERB be VERB inopportune ADJ to PRT disclose VERB my DET presence NOUN . .   
Not ADV that ADP I PRON intentionally ADV go VERB unperceived ADJ , . but CONJ the DET boulders NOUN up PRT there ADV are VERB very ADV high ADJ and CONJ I PRON am VERB a DET small ADJ woman NOUN . .   
One NUM other ADJ cause NOUN of ADP jealousy NOUN between ADP them PRON I PRON must VERB tell VERB you PRON . .

Gloomy ADJ and CONJ unkempt ADJ as ADP Red ADJ McIver NOUN was VERB , . he PRON was VERB much ADV the DET better ADJ painter NOUN . .   
I PRON suppose VERB Handley NOUN knew VERB it PRON . .   
If ADP Red NOUN had VERB a DET show NOUN at ADP Gloucester NOUN , . Handley NOUN would VERB hurry VERB to PRT hang VERB his DET pictures NOUN in ADP Rockport NOUN . .   
You PRON may VERB say VERB this DET has VERB little ADJ pertinence NOUN , . but CONJ , . gentlemen NOUN , . remember VERB that ADP all PRT this DET prepared VERB my DET mind NOUN , . alerted VERB my DET intelligence NOUN . .   
By ADP such ADJ touches NOUN the DET pattern NOUN takes VERB shape NOUN . .   
You PRON would VERB call VERB these DET the DET motives NOUN of ADP crime NOUN . .   
I PRON would VERB call VERB them PRON the DET patterns NOUN of ADP life NOUN , . perhaps ADV even ADV the DET designs NOUN of ADP destiny NOUN . .   
Yet ADV with ADP all PRT this DET knowledge NOUN I PRON had VERB nothing NOUN of ADP substance NOUN to PRT unravel VERB our DET case NOUN , . as ADP you PRON would VERB call VERB it PRON , . till ADP yesterday NOUN . .   
One NUM month NOUN ago ADV , . on ADP the DET 20th ADJ of ADP October NOUN , . was VERB the DET opening NOUN of ADP the DET gunning VERB season NOUN in ADP Massachusetts NOUN . .   
Not ADV much ADJ to PRT shoot VERB , . but CONJ there PRT are VERB a DET few ADJ pheasant NOUN . .   
Rabbits NOUN , . too ADV , . if ADP you PRON care VERB for ADP them PRON , . which DET most ADJ of ADP the DET folk NOUN around ADP here ADV haven't VERB the DET sense NOUN to PRT appreciate VERB . .   
Any DET more ADV than ADP they PRON have VERB the DET sense NOUN to PRT eat VERB mussels NOUN . .   
That DET was VERB the DET day NOUN Red NOUN was VERB said VERB to PRT have VERB gone VERB away ADV . .   
Oh PRT yes ADV , . he'd PRT talked VERB about ADP doing VERB so ADV . .   
In ADP fact NOUN , . he PRON often ADV disappeared VERB , . from ADP time NOUN to ADP time NOUN , . -- . off PRT to PRT paint VERB the DET sea NOUN , . aboard ADV a DET dragger NOUN out PRT from ADP Gloucester NOUN . .   
Anta NOUN , . his DET wife NOUN , . never ADV seemed VERB to PRT mind VERB . .   
I PRON suppose VERB these DET absences NOUN gave VERB her PRON more ADJ clearance NOUN for ADP her DET embraces NOUN with ADP Cousin NOUN Handley NOUN . .   
Anyhow ADV , . I PRON wasn't VERB surprised VERB , . early ADV that DET morning NOUN , . to PRT see VERB Handley NOUN himself PRON crossing VERB from ADP Dogtown NOUN Common NOUN Road NOUN to ADP the DET Back ADJ Road NOUN . .   
No ADV , . he PRON didn't VERB have VERB his DET gun NOUN , . which DET he PRON should VERB have VERB . .   
It PRON would VERB have VERB been VERB a DET good ADJ excuse NOUN for ADP his DET being VERB there ADV at ADP all PRT . .   
I PRON myself PRON had VERB been VERB up PRT there ADV by ADP seven NUM o'clock ADV , . after ADP mushrooms NOUN , . since ADP there'd PRT been VERB a DET week NOUN of ADP rain NOUN which DET had VERB stopped VERB early ADV that DET morning NOUN and CONJ the DET day NOUN was VERB as ADV clear ADJ as ADP Sandwich NOUN glass NOUN . .   
That's PRT what DET the DET man NOUN had VERB said VERB . .   
Haney NOUN peered VERB doubtfully ADV at ADP his DET drinking VERB companion NOUN through ADP bleary ADJ , . tear-filled ADJ eyes NOUN . .   
He PRON had VERB no DET ready ADJ answer NOUN , . as ADV much ADV from ADP surprise NOUN as ADP from ADP the DET fit NOUN of ADP coughing VERB . .   
Was VERB the DET man NOUN drunk ADJ or CONJ crazy ADJ or CONJ both DET ? . ? .   
But CONJ his DET new-found ADJ buddy NOUN had VERB matched VERB him PRON drink NOUN for ADP drink NOUN until ADP he PRON lost VERB count NOUN , . and CONJ the DET man's NOUN eyes NOUN were VERB still ADV clear ADJ . .   
The DET guy NOUN is VERB off ADP his DET rocker NOUN , . Haney NOUN thought VERB to ADP himself PRON , . and CONJ looked VERB away ADV from ADP those DET eyes NOUN . .   
Eyes NOUN that PRON were VERB clear ADJ , . but CONJ also ADV bright ADJ with ADP a DET strange ADJ intensity NOUN , . a DET sort NOUN of ADP cold ADJ fire NOUN burning VERB behind ADP them PRON . .   
Why ADV hadn't VERB he PRON noticed VERB it PRON before ADV ? . ? .   
No ADV , . the DET man NOUN was VERB not ADV drunk ADJ   
He PRON wondered VERB how ADV he PRON got VERB tied VERB up PRT with ADP this DET stranger NOUN . .   
But CONJ , . of ADP course NOUN , . he PRON remembered VERB now ADV . .   
It PRON was VERB blurred VERB , . after ADP two NUM hours NOUN of ADP steady ADJ drinking NOUN , . but CONJ the DET occasion NOUN of ADP it PRON came VERB back ADV to ADP him PRON . .   
The DET stranger NOUN , . his DET head NOUN seemingly ADV sunk VERB in ADP thought NOUN , . started VERB to PRT cross VERB the DET street NOUN against ADP the DET light NOUN just ADV as ADP a DET huge ADJ moving VERB van NOUN roared VERB through ADP the DET intersection NOUN . .   
Brakes NOUN howled VERB and CONJ a DET horn NOUN blared VERB furiously ADV , . but CONJ the DET man NOUN would VERB have VERB been VERB hit VERB if ADP Phil NOUN hadn't VERB called VERB out PRT to ADP him PRON a DET second NOUN before ADV . .   
His DET shout NOUN had VERB been VERB involuntary ADJ , . something NOUN anybody NOUN might VERB have VERB done VERB without ADP thinking VERB , . on ADP the DET spur NOUN of ADP the DET moment NOUN . .   
As ADP a DET matter NOUN of ADP fact NOUN , . he PRON wouldn't VERB have VERB cared VERB at ADP all PRT if ADP the DET guy NOUN had VERB been VERB hit VERB . .   
Actually ADV , . he PRON regretted VERB having VERB opened VERB his DET mouth NOUN when ADV the DET truck NOUN came VERB to ADP a DET stop NOUN and CONJ the DET angry ADJ driver NOUN jumped VERB down PRT from ADP the DET cab NOUN and CONJ walked VERB back ADV toward ADP them PRON . .   
By ADP then ADV , . the DET stranger NOUN was VERB thanking VERB Haney NOUN profusely ADV and CONJ had VERB one NUM arm NOUN around ADP his DET shoulders NOUN as ADP if ADP he PRON were VERB an DET old ADJ friend NOUN . .   
So ADP the DET driver NOUN started VERB to PRT curse VERB at ADP both DET of ADP them PRON as ADP if ADP they PRON had VERB been VERB in ADP a DET plot NOUN together ADV to PRT ruin VERB his DET safe-driving NOUN record NOUN . .   
Then ADV the DET man NOUN he PRON saved VERB turned VERB and CONJ looked VERB squarely ADV into ADP the DET truck NOUN driver's NOUN face NOUN , . without ADP saying VERB a DET word NOUN . .   
Very ADV suddenly ADV , . the DET driver NOUN stopped VERB swearing VERB at ADP them PRON , . turned VERB on ADP his DET heel NOUN and CONJ went VERB back ADV to ADP his DET truck NOUN . .   
Haney NOUN hadn't VERB given VERB it PRON much ADJ thought NOUN at ADP the DET time NOUN . .   
Now ADV he PRON recalled VERB it PRON very ADV clearly ADV , . and CONJ wondered VERB what DET the DET truck NOUN driver NOUN had VERB seen VERB in ADP those DET eyes NOUN to PRT make VERB him PRON back VERB off PRT . .   
It PRON must VERB have VERB been VERB the DET sort NOUN of ADP look NOUN that PRON can VERB call VERB a DET bluff NOUN without ADP saying VERB a DET word NOUN . .   
When ADV the DET light NOUN went VERB their DET way NOUN , . they PRON went VERB on PRT across ADP the DET street NOUN . .   
And CONJ when ADV the DET stranger NOUN found VERB out PRT that ADP Phil NOUN was VERB on ADP the DET way NOUN to ADP one NUM of ADP his DET favorite ADJ bars NOUN , . he PRON insisted VERB on ADP offering VERB to PRT buy VERB drinks NOUN for ADP both DET of ADP them PRON . .   
Phil NOUN usually ADV went VERB alone ADV and CONJ kept VERB to ADP himself PRON , . sitting VERB in ADP a DET corner NOUN and CONJ passing VERB the DET time NOUN by ADP nursing VERB his DET favorite ADJ grudges NOUN . .   
But CONJ he PRON decided VERB he PRON wouldn't VERB mind VERB company NOUN in ADP return NOUN for ADP free ADJ drinks NOUN , . even ADV though ADP he PRON made VERB good ADJ money NOUN at ADP his DET job NOUN . .   
Phil NOUN was VERB like ADP that DET . .   
Now ADV he PRON wondered VERB if ADP it PRON was VERB worth ADJ it PRON , . having VERB a DET screwball NOUN for ADP company NOUN . .   
He PRON really ADV didn't VERB take VERB the DET offer NOUN seriously ADV , . but CONJ he PRON began VERB to PRT feel VERB uneasy ADJ . .   
When ADV he PRON finally ADV got VERB the DET coughing NOUN under ADP control NOUN , . he PRON realized VERB that ADP Pete NOUN ( . all PRT he PRON gave VERB was VERB his DET first ADJ name NOUN ) . was VERB still ADV waiting VERB for ADP an DET answer NOUN -- . he PRON didn't VERB even ADV seem VERB to PRT wink VERB as ADP he PRON continued VERB to PRT stare VERB . .   
Haney NOUN managed VERB a DET weak ADJ laugh NOUN . .   
`` . Guess VERB I PRON can't VERB think VERB of ADP anyone NOUN , . Pete NOUN . .

A DET faint ADJ crease NOUN appeared VERB between ADP the DET man's NOUN eyebrows NOUN . .   
`` . I PRON think VERB you PRON aren't VERB taking VERB me PRON seriously ADV , . Phil NOUN . .

I PRON might VERB have VERB got VERB hit VERB by ADP that DET truck NOUN if ADP it PRON wasn't VERB for ADP you PRON . .   
I PRON believe VERB in ADP returning VERB favors NOUN . .   
I'll PRT do VERB anything NOUN for ADP somebody NOUN I PRON like VERB . .

Phil NOUN rubbed VERB his DET forehead NOUN wearily ADV . .   
He PRON was VERB beginning VERB to PRT feel VERB woolly ADJ . .   
Maybe ADV it PRON would VERB be VERB better ADJ to PRT humor VERB the DET guy NOUN and CONJ then ADV make VERB an DET exit NOUN . .   
He PRON really ADV didn't VERB expect VERB anything NOUN to PRT come VERB of ADP it PRON , . and CONJ there PRT were VERB a DET few ADJ people NOUN   
`` . All ADV right ADV '' . , . he PRON conceded VERB finally ADV , . `` . if ADP you PRON must VERB know VERB , . I PRON don't VERB get VERB along ADV with ADP the DET landlord NOUN . .   
He PRON keeps VERB riding VERB me PRON because ADP I PRON like VERB to PRT listen VERB to ADP the DET radio NOUN and CONJ sing VERB while ADP I'm PRT taking VERB a DET bath NOUN . .   
He PRON says VERB the DET neighbors NOUN complain VERB , . but CONJ I PRON don't VERB believe VERB it PRON . .   
Why ADV don't VERB they PRON tell VERB me PRON themselves PRON if ADP it PRON bothers VERB them PRON '' . ? . ? .   
The DET man NOUN closed VERB his DET eyes NOUN and CONJ nodded VERB . .   
When ADV he PRON looked VERB up PRT again ADV , . he PRON seemed VERB almost ADV contented VERB . .

The DET hangover NOUN in ADP turn NOUN reminded VERB him PRON of ADP his DET conversation NOUN with ADP the DET weirdy NOUN , . and CONJ he PRON groaned VERB . .   
He PRON went VERB for ADP more ADJ aspirin NOUN later ADV in ADP the DET day NOUN , . and CONJ passed VERB the DET surly ADJ landlord NOUN on ADP the DET way NOUN -- . he PRON was VERB still ADV alive ADJ and CONJ scowling VERB as ADV usual ADJ , . as ADP if ADP tenants NOUN were VERB a DET burden NOUN in ADP his DET life NOUN . .   
Phil NOUN shrugged VERB and CONJ ignored VERB him PRON . .   
He PRON went VERB back ADV to ADP work NOUN Monday NOUN . .   
By ADP Wednesday NOUN the DET landlord NOUN was VERB still ADV alive ADJ . .   
Of ADP course NOUN On ADP Thursday NOUN , . Haney NOUN mailed VERB the DET monthly ADJ check NOUN for ADP separate ADJ maintenance NOUN to ADP his DET wife NOUN Lolly NOUN , . and CONJ wished VERB the DET stranger NOUN could VERB do VERB something NOUN about ADP her PRON   
Coming VERB home NOUN from ADP work NOUN , . he PRON was VERB startled VERB to PRT see VERB a DET police NOUN car NOUN parked VERB in ADP front NOUN of ADP the DET apartment NOUN building NOUN . .   
Inside ADP the DET lobby NOUN , . people NOUN were VERB standing VERB around ADV , . talking VERB excitedly ADV . .   
His DET spine NOUN crawled VERB with ADP a DET foreboding VERB premonition NOUN as ADP he PRON asked VERB one NUM of ADP his DET fellow NOUN tenants NOUN what DET had VERB happened VERB . .   
The DET landlord NOUN had VERB died VERB . .   
Late ADV that DET afternoon NOUN , . it PRON seemed VERB , . he PRON had VERB fallen VERB off ADP the DET roof NOUN while ADP on ADP some DET obscure ADJ errand NOUN or CONJ inspection NOUN . .   
He PRON had VERB apparently ADV been VERB alone ADV . .   
Nobody NOUN witnessed VERB the DET fall NOUN -- . just ADV the DET sickening VERB impact NOUN when ADV his DET body NOUN smashed VERB on ADP the DET pavement NOUN just ADV outside ADP the DET basement NOUN delivery NOUN entrance NOUN . .   
Haney NOUN hoped VERB that ADP nobody NOUN noticed VERB his DET sudden ADJ pallor NOUN , . as ADP he PRON felt VERB the DET blood NOUN drain NOUN from ADP his DET cheeks NOUN . .   
He PRON muttered VERB something NOUN about ADP how ADV terrible ADJ it PRON was VERB , . and CONJ walked VERB with ADP deliberate ADJ slowness NOUN to ADP the DET elevator NOUN . .   
Once ADV inside ADP his DET apartment NOUN , . he PRON poured VERB a DET drink NOUN with ADP trembling VERB hands NOUN and CONJ flopped VERB limply ADV in ADP a DET chair NOUN . .   
After ADP a DET while NOUN he PRON began VERB to PRT feel VERB better ADV about ADP it PRON , . especially ADV when ADV no DET one NOUN bothered VERB to PRT ask VERB any DET questions NOUN . .   
But CONJ after ADP all PRT , . why ADV should VERB they PRON ? . ? .   
Still ADV later ADV , . he PRON finally ADV convinced VERB himself PRON that ADP it PRON was VERB an DET accident NOUN -- . just ADV a DET coincidence NOUN . .   
The DET stranger NOUN really ADV had VERB nothing NOUN to PRT do VERB with ADP it PRON , . of ADP course NOUN   
Haney NOUN went VERB to ADP bed NOUN , . happy ADJ that ADP at ADP least ADJ he PRON was VERB rid ADJ of ADP that DET lousy ADJ landlord NOUN . .   
After ADP all PRT , . the DET man NOUN had VERB no DET family NOUN , . so ADP no DET one NOUN suffered VERB , . and CONJ everybody NOUN was VERB better ADJ off PRT for ADP it PRON . .   
Really ADV , . he PRON said VERB to ADP himself PRON , . nobody NOUN kills VERB a DET man NOUN just ADV as ADP a DET favor NOUN ! . ! .   
So ADV you PRON thought VERB I PRON didn't VERB mean VERB what DET I PRON said VERB . .   
The DET stranger's NOUN eyes NOUN were VERB large ADJ and CONJ sad ADJ , . as ADP if ADP Phil NOUN Haney NOUN had VERB hurt NOUN his DET feelings NOUN . .   
It PRON was VERB like ADP a DET recurrent ADJ , . annoying ADJ dream NOUN , . but CONJ now ADV the DET dream NOUN was VERB beginning VERB to PRT take VERB on ADP overtones NOUN of ADP a DET nightmare NOUN . .   
However ADV , . Haney NOUN knew VERB it PRON was VERB not ADV a DET dream NOUN . .   
He PRON might VERB be VERB very ADV tight ADJ , . but CONJ he PRON knew VERB where ADV he PRON was VERB . .   
It PRON was VERB the DET same ADJ bar NOUN , . and CONJ it PRON was VERB two NUM weeks NOUN later ADV -- . Saturday NOUN night NOUN , . when ADV he PRON had VERB an DET excuse NOUN to PRT drink VERB heavier ADV than ADP usual ADJ . .   
He PRON had VERB been VERB sitting VERB in ADP the DET usual ADJ corner NOUN at ADP the DET little ADJ table NOUN , . as ADV far ADJ as ADP possible ADJ from ADP any DET talkative ADJ , . friendly ADJ lushes NOUN . .   
He PRON was VERB enjoying VERB the DET weekly ADJ ritual NOUN of ADP washing VERB down PRT his DET pet NOUN grievance NOUN with ADP bourbon NOUN slightly ADV moistened VERB with ADP water NOUN . .   
This DET favorite NOUN grievance NOUN was VERB not ADV the DET landlord NOUN . .   
He PRON had VERB already ADV quite ADV forgotten VERB about ADP him PRON . .   
In ADP fact NOUN , . he PRON had VERB only ADV mentioned VERB him PRON on ADP the DET spur NOUN of ADP the DET moment NOUN . .   
His DET real ADJ grievance NOUN was VERB Lolly NOUN . .   
Toward ADP the DET end NOUN of ADP his DET fourth ADJ hairy ADJ highball NOUN , . while ADP he PRON was VERB moodily ADV making VERB wet ADJ rings NOUN on ADP the DET table-top NOUN with ADP the DET bottom NOUN of ADP the DET glass NOUN , . he PRON became VERB aware ADJ that ADP he PRON was VERB not ADV alone ADV . .   
He PRON looked VERB up PRT with ADP bloodshot ADJ eyes NOUN and CONJ beheld VERB the DET stranger NOUN sitting VERB across ADP the DET table NOUN , . smiling VERB a DET secret ADJ smile NOUN at ADP him PRON , . as ADP if ADP they PRON were VERB fellow NOUN conspirators NOUN . .   
He PRON hadn't VERB even ADV noticed VERB -- . what DET was VERB his DET name NOUN ? . ? .   
Pete NOUN ? . ? .   
-- . he PRON hadn't VERB seen VERB him PRON sit VERB down PRT . .   
The DET man NOUN was VERB uncanny ADJ , . like ADP a DET shadow NOUN , . and CONJ made VERB as ADV much ADJ noise NOUN as ADP a DET shadow NOUN . .   
Haney NOUN felt VERB like ADP shrinking VERB out PRT of ADP sight NOUN , . but CONJ he PRON was VERB already ADV trapped VERB in ADP the DET corner NOUN with ADP the DET wiry ADJ , . dark ADJ little ADJ man NOUN . .   
He PRON began VERB to PRT wish VERB that ADP he PRON hadn't VERB shouted VERB that DET other ADJ evening NOUN when ADV the DET truck NOUN bore VERB down PRT through ADP the DET crossing NOUN . .   
Was VERB he PRON going VERB to PRT be VERB saddled VERB from ADP now ADV on PRT with ADP a DET creep NOUN for ADP a DET bar-buddy NOUN ? . ? .   
He'd PRT have VERB to PRT start VERB going VERB to ADP some DET of ADP the DET other ADJ places NOUN again ADV . .   
In ADP a DET low ADJ voice NOUN , . almost ADV whispering VERB , . the DET man NOUN had VERB asked VERB Phil NOUN if ADP he PRON was VERB happy ADJ with ADP the DET way NOUN the DET landlord NOUN had VERB been VERB taken VERB off ADP his DET back NOUN . .   
He PRON made VERB the DET mistake NOUN of ADP answering VERB in ADP an DET offhand ADJ way NOUN , . and CONJ instantly ADV realized VERB that ADP his DET skepticism NOUN must VERB have VERB showed VERB in ADP his DET face NOUN or CONJ voice NOUN . .   
Pete NOUN frowned VERB slightly ADV , . then ADV became VERB sad ADJ and CONJ moody ADJ . .   
Haney NOUN didn't VERB want VERB to PRT encourage VERB his DET company NOUN , . but CONJ felt VERB he PRON ought VERB to PRT buy VERB him PRON a DET drink NOUN anyhow ADV , . to PRT prevent VERB possible ADJ trouble NOUN . .   
But CONJ there PRT was VERB no DET trouble NOUN . .   
The DET guy NOUN sulked VERB over ADP his DET drink NOUN , . obviously ADV upset VERB by ADP Haney's NOUN lack NOUN of ADP appreciation NOUN . .   
To PRT break VERB the DET uncomfortable ADJ silence NOUN , . Haney NOUN began VERB to PRT talk VERB . .   
In ADP time NOUN , . and CONJ two NUM drinks NOUN later ADV , . he PRON was VERB complaining VERB bitterly ADV about ADP his DET wife NOUN , . He PRON was VERB on ADP the DET subject NOUN for ADP ten NUM minutes NOUN or CONJ so ADV when ADV he PRON noticed VERB the DET renewed VERB interest NOUN in ADP his DET listener NOUN -- . it PRON showed VERB in ADP the DET alert ADJ face NOUN and CONJ the DET suddenly ADV bright ADJ eyes NOUN . .   
When ADV he PRON paused VERB to PRT moisten VERB his DET throat NOUN , . the DET stranger NOUN broke VERB in PRT . .   
`` . But CONJ why ADV pay NOUN her DET bills NOUN ? . ? .   
If ADP she PRON runs VERB around ADV with ADP other ADJ men NOUN , . and CONJ if ADP you PRON hate VERB her PRON as ADP you PRON say VERB , . why ADV not ADV just ADV divorce VERB her PRON '' . ? . ? .   
Haney NOUN scowled VERB . .   
`` . That DET bitch NOUN would VERB love VERB a DET divorce NOUN '' . , . he PRON growled VERB . .   
`` . Then ADV she'd PRT get VERB half PRT of ADP everything NOUN I PRON have VERB . .

I'd PRT have VERB to PRT sell VERB out PRT my DET business NOUN to PRT pay VERB her PRON off PRT with ADP her DET share NOUN . .   
She PRON can VERB drop VERB dead ADJ '' . ! . ! .   
Pete NOUN nodded VERB understandingly ADV . .   
`` . Oh PRT yes ADV . .   
Now ADV I PRON see VERB . .   
You PRON must VERB understand VERB , . I PRON haven't VERB been VERB in ADP this DET state NOUN too ADV long ADJ . .

That's PRT why ADV I PRON -- . why ADV I PRON do VERB a DET free ADJ job NOUN now ADV and CONJ then ADV . .   
You PRON should VERB have VERB told VERB me PRON about ADP her PRON before ADV '' . . .   
Haney NOUN felt VERB a DET twinge NOUN of ADP annoyance NOUN when ADV he PRON heard VERB the DET now ADV familiar ADJ line NOUN again ADV . .   
Then ADV a DET wild ADJ thought NOUN ran VERB circles NOUN through ADP his DET clouded VERB brain NOUN . .   
Suppose VERB -- . just ADV suppose VERB this DET guy NOUN was VERB really ADV what DET he PRON said VERB he PRON was VERB ! . ! .   
A DET retired VERB professional ADJ killer NOUN If ADP he PRON was VERB just ADV a DET nut NOUN , . no DET harm NOUN was VERB done VERB . .   
But CONJ if ADP he PRON was VERB the DET real ADJ thing NOUN , . he PRON could VERB do VERB something NOUN about ADP Lolly NOUN . .   
He PRON felt VERB very ADV cunning ADJ , . very ADV proud ADJ of ADP himself PRON as ADP he PRON played VERB on ADP the DET other ADJ man's NOUN soft ADJ spot NOUN . .   
`` . No DET offense NOUN intended VERB '' . , . he PRON said VERB gently ADV . .   
`` . But CONJ it's PRT just ADV that ADP -- . well PRT , . you PRON know VERB . .   
The DET cops NOUN didn't VERB suspect VERB a DET thing NOUN , . and CONJ I PRON thought VERB it PRON was VERB a DET coincidence NOUN . .   
After ADP all PRT , . I PRON didn't VERB know VERB you PRON , . Pete NOUN . .   
It PRON could VERB have VERB been VERB an DET accident NOUN '' . . .   
He PRON shrugged VERB casually ADV . .   
`` . But CONJ if ADP you PRON say VERB you PRON managed VERB it PRON '' . The DET stranger NOUN was VERB hooked VERB . .   
His DET eyes NOUN burned VERB feverishly ADV . .   
`` . Yes ADV , . yes ADV '' . , . he PRON muttered VERB impatiently ADV . .   
`` . Of ADP course NOUN it PRON looked VERB like ADP an DET accident NOUN . .

Let VERB me PRON prove VERB it PRON , . Phil NOUN . .

He PRON waited VERB eagerly ADV . .   
Haney NOUN swished VERB the DET liquor NOUN in ADP the DET bottom NOUN of ADP his DET glass NOUN . .   
About ADV halfway ADV back ADV Pops NOUN groped VERB against ADP a DET wall NOUN and CONJ stopped VERB , . pulled VERB away ADV two NUM loosely ADV nailed VERB wide ADJ boards NOUN at ADP one NUM end NOUN , . and CONJ went VERB through PRT . .   
`` . C'mon PRT '' . , . he PRON whispered VERB ; . ; .   
`` . floor NOUN level's PRT about ADV three NUM feet NOUN down PRT , . so ADP don't VERB fall VERB '' . . .   
I PRON went VERB through ADP and CONJ down PRT , . into ADP pitch NOUN darkness NOUN . .

I PRON jist ADV stayed VERB where ADV I PRON was VERB while ADP he PRON fumbled VERB around ADV and CONJ then ADV walked VERB away ADV . .   
A DET moment NOUN later ADV he PRON struck VERB a DET match NOUN and CONJ lighted VERB a DET candle NOUN , . and CONJ I PRON could VERB see VERB . .   
It PRON was VERB a DET big ADJ room NOUN , . empty ADJ except ADP for ADP a DET few ADJ things NOUN of ADP Pops's NOUN at ADP the DET far ADJ end NOUN -- . a DET wooden ADJ crate NOUN on ADP which DET stood VERB the DET candle NOUN , . a DET spread VERB out PRT blanket NOUN , . and CONJ an DET unrolled VERB bindle NOUN . .

`` . You PRON first ADV '' . , . I PRON said VERB . .   
He PRON drank VERB and CONJ handed VERB it PRON back ADV . .

He PRON hesitated VERB a DET second NOUN , . looking VERB at ADP the DET bottle NOUN , . before ADP he PRON said VERB `` . Sure-sure PRT '' . , . and CONJ I PRON reassured VERB him PRON . .

On ADP the DET way NOUN I PRON gave VERB him PRON the DET scoop NOUN . .   
I PRON bought VERB another DET pint NOUN of ADP sherry NOUN and CONJ when ADV we PRON got VERB back ADV Pops NOUN let VERB us PRON in PRT in ADP the DET dark NOUN , . put VERB back ADV the DET blanket NOUN and CONJ then ADV lighted VERB the DET candle NOUN again ADV . .   
I PRON introduced VERB my DET friend NOUN Larry NOUN to ADP Pops NOUN and CONJ we PRON made VERB ourselves PRON comfortable ADJ . .   
There PRT was VERB still ADV a DET little ADJ , . not ADV much ADJ , . left VERB in ADP the DET first ADJ bottle NOUN and CONJ we PRON passed VERB it PRON around ADV once ADV and CONJ killed VERB it PRON , . and CONJ Charlie NOUN opened VERB his PRON . .   
I PRON was VERB reminded VERB , . amusedly ADV , . by ADP a DET poem NOUN of ADP Kenneth NOUN Patchen's NOUN called VERB The DET Murder NOUN of ADP Two NUM Men NOUN by ADP a DET Young ADJ Kid NOUN Wearing VERB Lemon NOUN Colored VERB Gloves NOUN , . which DET Patchen NOUN himself PRON read VERB on ADP a DET record NOUN against ADP jazz NOUN background NOUN . .

This DET was VERB the DET same ADJ , . except ADP that ADP it PRON was VERB the DET murder NOUN of ADP one NUM man NOUN by ADP two NUM men NOUN and CONJ neither DET of ADP us PRON was VERB wearing VERB gloves NOUN . .

We'd PRT heard VERB the DET record NOUN together ADV once ADV . .   
The DET second ADJ bottle NOUN passed VERB a DET few ADJ times NOUN . .   
Pops NOUN was VERB taking VERB long ADJ ones NOUN , . but CONJ not ADV showing VERB the DET effect NOUN yet ADV . .   
He PRON seemed VERB as ADV drunk ADJ as ADP when ADV I'd PRT first ADV talked VERB to ADP him PRON , . but CONJ no DET drunker ADJ . .

I PRON dug VERB him PRON , . I PRON saw VERB his DET point NOUN ; . ; .

I PRON took VERB the DET piece NOUN of ADP pipe NOUN from ADP Charlie's NOUN hand NOUN and CONJ used VERB it PRON , . harder ADV than ADP he PRON had VERB . .   
The DET thunk NOUN was VERB louder ADJ , . anyway ADV , . and CONJ I PRON thought VERB I PRON heard VERB bone NOUN crack VERB . .

`` . How ADV do VERB you PRON feel VERB '' . ? . ? .   
Charlie NOUN asked VERB me PRON . .

the DET Gabriel NOUN pointed VERB towards ADP her PRON destination NOUN and CONJ , . under ADP one-gee ADJ acceleration NOUN , . began VERB to PRT build VERB up PRT towards ADP her DET ultimate ADJ velocity NOUN , . 99.1 NUM percent NOUN of ADP the DET speed NOUN of ADP light NOUN . .   
Meanwhile ADV , . all PRT the DET personnel NOUN except ADP those DET few ADJ needed VERB to PRT carry VERB out PRT the DET performance NOUN of ADP the DET ship NOUN , . went VERB into ADP the DET suspensor NOUN . .   
Here ADV they PRON would VERB lie VERB in ADP suspended VERB animation NOUN for ADP many ADJ years NOUN . .   
Some DET time NOUN later ADV , . after ADP a DET check NOUN had VERB been VERB made VERB of ADP all PRT automatic ADJ equipment NOUN , . the DET crew NOUN would VERB join VERB the DET others NOUN . .   
They PRON would VERB sleep VERB while ADP the DET Gabriel's NOUN drive NOUN would VERB increase VERB the DET acceleration NOUN to ADP a DET point NOUN which DET the DET unfrozen VERB bodies NOUN of ADP the DET personnel NOUN could VERB not ADV have VERB endured VERB . .   
Upon ADP reaching VERB the DET desired VERB speed NOUN , . the DET automatic ADJ equipment NOUN would VERB cut VERB off PRT the DET drive NOUN , . and CONJ the DET silent ADJ but CONJ not ADV empty ADJ vessel NOUN would VERB hurl VERB towards ADP the DET star NOUN which DET was VERB its DET journey's NOUN end NOUN . .   
Many ADJ years NOUN later ADV , . the DET photon-counting ADJ apparatus NOUN in ADP the DET nose NOUN of ADP the DET ship NOUN would VERB determine VERB that ADP the DET star NOUN was VERB close ADJ enough ADV to PRT actuate VERB deceleration NOUN . .   
Again ADV , . a DET force NOUN too ADV strong ADJ for ADP unfrozen VERB bodies NOUN to PRT endure VERB would VERB be VERB applied VERB . .

And CONJ the DET crew NOUN would VERB be VERB automatically ADV brought VERB out ADP of ADP their DET suspended VERB animation NOUN . .   
These DET members NOUN would VERB then ADV unthaw VERB the DET rest NOUN of ADP the DET personnel NOUN . .   
And CONJ , . in ADP the DET half-year NOUN left VERB before ADP reaching VERB their DET destination NOUN , . the DET men NOUN would VERB carry VERB out PRT whatever DET preparations NOUN were VERB needed VERB . .   
Hal NOUN Yarrow NOUN was VERB among ADP the DET last ADJ to PRT go VERB into ADP the DET suspensor NOUN and CONJ among ADP the DET first ADJ to PRT come VERB out PRT . .   
He PRON had VERB to PRT study VERB the DET recordings NOUN of ADP the DET language NOUN of ADP the DET chief NOUN nation NOUN of ADP Ozagen NOUN , . Siddo NOUN . .   
And CONJ , . from ADP the DET first ADV , . he PRON faced VERB a DET difficult ADJ task NOUN . .   
The DET expedition NOUN that PRON had VERB discovered VERB Ozagen NOUN had VERB succeeded VERB in ADP correlating VERB two NUM thousand NUM Siddo NOUN words NOUN with ADP an DET equal ADJ number NOUN of ADP American ADJ words NOUN . .   
The DET description NOUN of ADP the DET Siddo NOUN syntax NOUN was VERB very ADV restricted VERB . .   
And CONJ , . as ADP Hal NOUN found VERB out PRT , . obviously ADV mistaken VERB in ADP many ADJ cases NOUN . .   
This DET discovery NOUN caused VERB Hal NOUN anxiety NOUN . .   
His DET duty NOUN was VERB to PRT write VERB a DET school NOUN text NOUN and CONJ to PRT teach VERB the DET entire ADJ personnel NOUN of ADP the DET Gabriel NOUN how ADV to PRT speak VERB Ozagen NOUN . .   
Yet ADV , . if ADP he PRON used VERB all PRT of ADP the DET little ADJ means NOUN at ADP his DET disposal NOUN , . he PRON would VERB be VERB instructing VERB his DET students NOUN wrongly ADV . .   
Moreover ADV , . even ADV getting VERB this DET across ADV would VERB be VERB difficult ADJ . .   
For ADP one NUM thing NOUN , . the DET organs NOUN of ADP speech NOUN of ADP the DET Ozagen NOUN natives NOUN differed VERB somewhat ADV from ADP Earthmen's NOUN ; . ; .   
the DET sounds NOUN made VERB by ADP these DET organs NOUN were VERB , . therefore ADV , . dissimilar ADJ . .   
It PRON was VERB true ADJ that ADP they PRON could VERB be VERB approximated VERB , . but CONJ would VERB the DET Ozagenians NOUN understand VERB these DET approximations NOUN ? . ? .   
Another DET obstacle NOUN was VERB the DET grammatical ADJ construction NOUN of ADP Siddo NOUN . .   
Consider VERB the DET tense NOUN system NOUN . .   
Instead ADV of ADP inflecting VERB a DET verb NOUN or CONJ using VERB an DET unattached ADJ particle NOUN to PRT indicate VERB the DET past NOUN or CONJ future NOUN , . Siddo NOUN used VERB an DET entirely ADV different ADJ word NOUN . .   
Thus ADV , . the DET masculine ADJ animate ADJ infinitive NOUN dabhumaksanigalu'ahai X , . meaning VERB to PRT live VERB , . was VERB , . in ADP the DET perfect ADJ tense NOUN , . ksu'u'peli'afo X , . and CONJ , . in ADP the DET future NOUN , . mai'teipa X . .   
The DET same ADJ use NOUN of ADP an DET entirely ADV different ADJ word NOUN applied VERB for ADP all PRT the DET other ADJ tenses NOUN . .   
Plus ADP the DET fact NOUN that ADP Siddo NOUN not ADV only ADV had VERB the DET normal ADJ ( . to ADP Earthmen NOUN ) . three NUM genders NOUN of ADP masculine ADJ , . feminine ADJ , . and CONJ neuter ADJ , . but CONJ the DET two NUM extra ADJ of ADP inanimate ADJ and CONJ spiritual ADJ . .   
Fortunately ADV , . gender NOUN was VERB inflected VERB , . though ADP the DET expression NOUN of ADP it PRON would VERB be VERB difficult ADJ for ADP anybody NOUN not ADV born VERB in ADP Siddo NOUN . .   
The DET system NOUN of ADP indicating VERB gender NOUN varied VERB according ADV to ADP tense NOUN . .   
All ADV the DET other ADJ parts NOUN of ADP speech NOUN : . nouns NOUN , . pronouns NOUN , . adjectives NOUN , . adverbs NOUN , . and CONJ conjunctions NOUN operated VERB under ADP the DET same ADJ system NOUN as ADP the DET verbs NOUN . .   
This DET was VERB not ADV , . for ADP the DET Angel NOUN , . just ADV a DET matter NOUN of ADP running VERB through ADP a DET logical ADJ or CONJ deductive ADJ chain NOUN , . or CONJ deciding VERB on PRT some DET action NOUN from ADP some DET already ADV established VERB premise NOUN . .

It PRON might VERB have VERB been VERB several ADJ days NOUN . .

Once ADV again ADV B'dikkat NOUN moved VERB among ADP them PRON like ADP a DET father NOUN ; . ; .
